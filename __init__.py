"""
ScrapIt package has a philosophy, if you want to scrap a website, that website must have a list to scrap
and if that website has a list to scrap, then the list must have items. This idea is enough to abstract
the scraping process into a single yet intelligent scraper class. We don't need to know what your website is.
This is handled by special configuration files.
